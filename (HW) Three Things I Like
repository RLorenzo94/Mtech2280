One of the artist that i saw that i really liked was Peter Vogel, what he brings to
the table I hink is amazing. He takes sound to a new level with his, Sound Wall project. 
Furthermore, the sound wall is enabled with shadow, and it  triggers different repettitive sounds.
For this project, i would need to learn how to use the appropiate sensors and resistors in the right place.

The  Graffiti Resarch Lab invented somthing incredible which was the EyeDraw which lets the user
draw with only their eyes! This innovation i found amazing because people with paralysis can 
still do what they love to do which is drawing. In order for this project to work you'll 
need some sort of camera and tweaking the hardware a bit. 

Lastly, the artist that i also really liked were the Barbicans and their project called, Rain Room.
This truly moves me to get at their level in some point, the fact that you walk under the water and 
you dont get wet becuase the sensors feel you moving and coordinate with your location is more than
genius to me. The way it really woks is that they have 3d sensors that detect your movement and your 
location and tells the water to stop flowing in the places you are located... Thumbs up!
